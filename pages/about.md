# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

A 21 year old still figuring out how the world works, you can count me in if the conversation is about books, movies or MasterChef Australia. 

I have lately realised that I am naturally good at public speaking and interact better with people when on a stage, hence, that is something I have been trying to hone in the past few months. 

Currently, I am working as a Data Science Trainer for Dimensionless, which pays me enough to buy books without any guilt of overspending. 

I also hope to pursue postgraduate studies starting this year, although I do realise managing studies with work might get difficult but we will figure out something once we get there. 

One thing I have always tried to keep alive in myself is curiosity, so don't hesitate on recommending any documentary or biography to me. 

I also indulge in coloring as a very personal hobby. 

All in all, I just want to be a kind, gentle, happy soul in this difficult, difficult world.
